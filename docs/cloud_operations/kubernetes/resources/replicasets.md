# [ReplicaSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)

## Goals
1. **Understand Kubernetes ReplicaSets**:
    - Learn what a ReplicaSet is and its role in the Kubernetes architecture.
1. **Advantages of Using ReplicaSets vs. Simple Pods**
    - Figure out why you should be almost always be using a ReplicaSet in production instead of a simple Pod.
1. **Basic Example(s)**:
    - Provide (a) basic example(s) of ReplicaSet resources.
    - Show how to define a ReplicaSet using YAML.
1. **ReplicaSet Spec Explanation**:
    - Explain the components of the ReplicaSet specification using the example(s) above.
1. **Exercise**:
    - Hands-on activity to create a simple ReplicaSet.

## Understanding Kubernetes ReplicaSets

A **ReplicaSet** in Kubernetes is a controller that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. If a pod goes down, the ReplicaSet will automatically create a new one to maintain the desired number of replicas.

## Advantages of Using ReplicaSets vs. Simple Pods

1. **Automatic Scaling**:
   - ReplicaSets automatically create new Pods to replace any that fail, ensuring the desired number of Pods are always running.

2. **Declarative Management**:
   - You can define the desired state (e.g., number of replicas) in a YAML file, and Kubernetes maintains that state automatically.

3. **Rolling Updates**:
   - ReplicaSets, when used with Deployments, allow you to update your application with zero downtime by gradually replacing old Pods with new ones.

4. **Consistency and Reliability**:
   - ReplicaSets ensure that your application consistently has the necessary resources to handle its workload by maintaining a fixed number of replicas.

5. **Label Selection**:
   - ReplicaSets use labels to manage Pods, allowing you to adjust which Pods are managed by the ReplicaSet through label changes.

6. **Simplified Management**:
   - Instead of managing individual Pods, ReplicaSets provide a single point of control for a group of Pods, making operations like scaling and updates easier.

## Basic ReplicaSet Example

### Simple ReplicaSet

Here is a basic example of a Kubernetes ReplicaSet specification in YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: example-replicaset
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21.6
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This ReplicaSet ensures that three replicas of the `nginx` container are running at all times.

Save this to a file `replicaset.yaml` and create the resource using `kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml`:

```sh
> kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
replicaset.apps/example-replicaset created
```

## ReplicaSet Spec Explanation

1. **apiVersion**: apps/v1 (API group and version)
1. **kind**: ReplicaSet (type of the resource)
1. **metadata**: [ObjectMeta](./object-meta.md)
1. **spec**: [ReplicaSetSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.30/#replicasetspec-v1-apps)
   - **replicas**: The desired number of pod replicas.
   - **selector**: The label selector used to identify the pods managed by the ReplicaSet.
   - **template**: The pod template that defines the pods to be created.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Simple ReplicaSet

**Objective**: Deploy a ReplicaSet that ensures a specific number of pods are running.

**Task**:
- Define a ReplicaSet that runs three replicas of an `nginx` container.
- Verify that the desired number of replicas are running.
- Test scaling by increasing or decreasing the number of replicas in the ReplicaSet definition.

:::tip

If you want to scale the ReplicaSet, you can edit the `replicas` field in the YAML file and reapply it or use the following command:

```sh
kubectl scale replicaset example-replicaset --replicas=5
```
