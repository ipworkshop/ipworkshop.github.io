# x86_64 Poweroff

:::info
This driver works only on x86_64.
:::

We will build a driver that powers off QEMU.

##  Power Off

QEMU provides a virtual peripheral called ISA Debug Exit that maps an IO port. Writing a numeric value to this port
will power off QEMU and return the value as an error code.

Attaching this device to QEMU is done by adding `-device isa-debug-exit,iobase=0x10f4,iosize=0x04` to the command line.
In this example, the debug device is mapped on port `0x10f4` and is 4 bytes long.

## Simple Power Off Driver

The simplest driver that we can write is one that power off QEMU when it is loaded. 
We need to:
- reserve the port
- write to it using x86 assembly

### Reserving the port region

:::note
The Kernel Rust API does not have (yet) and safe abstraction to reserve a port. This means that
we have to use the C binding directly,
:::

```rust
unsafe { bindings::request_region(start, len, name.as_char_ptr()) }
```

- `start` is the port number
- `len` is the gthe length of the port
- `name` is a name that will be displayed in `/proc/ioports` and is a C string `char*`

The function return `NULL` if the port mapping fails. In Rust, we can use the `.is_null()` function 
to check if the port reservation worked.

### Writing to the port

Writing to the IO port is done using inline assembly. There are two possible syntaxes:

#### Kernel AT&T Syntax

```rust
// kernel API
use kernel::asm;
unsafe {
    asm!("
            outb %al, %dx
        ";
        in("dx") port as u16, 
        in("al") value as u8,
        options(noreturn)
    );
}
```

#### Intel Syntax

```rust
// core API
use core::arch::asm;
unsafe {
    asm!("
            out dx, al 
        ",
        in("dx") port as u16, 
        in("al") value as u8,
        options(intel_syntax, noreturn)
    );
}
```

:::warning
The kernel does not forbid writing to a port without reserving it, but this is bad practice, 
as we might override another driver's ports. if we cannot reserve a port, we just back off
and fail to load the driver returning a `EBUSY` error.
:::

### Releasing the port region

If we have reserved a port region, we must make sure to release it when we do not need it anymore
or when we unload the driver.

```rust
unsafe { bindings::release_region(start, len); }
```

## Exercises

1. Write an empty module called `PowerOff`
2. Reserve the `0x10f4` port with 4 bytes long in the `Module::init` function. 
  - Print the contents of `/proc/ioports` to see if your port has been reserved
  - Try reserving a port that already exists and fail to initialize the module
3. Release the `0x10f4` port with 4 bytes long in the `Drop::drop` function.
