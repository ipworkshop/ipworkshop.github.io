# ARM64 Poweroff

:::info
This driver works only on ARM64.
:::

We will build a driver that powers off QEMU.

##  Power Off

QEMU provides the `semihosting` interface and the [Power State Coordination Interface](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0022/latest/) (PSCI) interface. Both can be used to power off QEMU, the first one is returning a value to QEMU.

A simple driver that we can write is one that powers off QEMU when it is loaded. 

### Using `semihosting`

This is used for debugging ARM devices, it basically traps the `hlt` instruction with the `0xf000` argument 
and uses them similar to hypervisor calls. It executes actions based on the values found in the registers.
- register `x0` stores the command `SYS_*`
- register `x1` stores a reference (pointer) to the exit reason

We have to enable `semihsoting` in  QEMU by appending `-semihosting` to the command line.

```rust
unsafe {
    asm!("
            hlt #0xF000
        ";
        in("x0") 0x18_u64,      // SYS_EXIT
        in("x1") &0x20026u64,   // Reason ApplicationExit
        options(noreturn)
    );
};
```

### Using PCSI

We need to use the `PSCI_SYSTEM_OFF` hypervisor call.

We use the `hvc` instruction in inline assembly.

```rust
// kernel API (use kernel::asm)
unsafe {
    asm!(
        "hvc #0";
        in("x0") 0x8400_0008_u64,  // PSCI SYSTEM_OFF (SMC32 ID)
        options(noreturn)
    );
};
```

## Exercises

1. Write an empty module called `PowerOff`
2. Use the `hvc` instruction with `x0` set to `0x8400_0008`.
