# Introduction

## Rust Desktop Applications in Slint

Hey there! Super excited to welcome you to the world of desktop application development. We know it might seem a bit daunting at first, but trust us, you're in for a really cool ride.

We're going to dive deep into Rust â€“ a programming language that's making waves because it helps you build incredibly fast and reliable apps, all while keeping things safe. Then, we'll jump into Slint, a UI toolkit that lets you design awesome-looking desktop interfaces with ease, perfectly paired with Rust's power.

Our goal here isn't just to throw a bunch of code at you. We want to show you how much fun it can be to actually _build_ something tangible that runs right on your computer. By the end of this course, we genuinely hope you'll be hooked on Rust and ready to start tackling your own real-world projects. Let's get building some amazing stuff together!
