### Project Ideas

Here are a few project ideas, ranging from desktop utilities to educational tools, that leverage various programming concepts. Each project is designed to help you build practical skills and create a portfolio-ready application.

---

#### 🌍 Country Guesser

Create a game that challenges users to identify a country based on data retrieved from an API, such as `REST Countries`. This project will focus on **HTTP requests**, **JSON parsing**, and handling **asynchronous data**. You can present information like the country's flag, capital city, or population, prompting the user to make a guess.

#### 🔐 Cryptography Application

Build a simple desktop application for encrypting and decrypting messages. Implement classic ciphers like the **Caesar Cipher** or the **XOR Cipher**. This project will strengthen your understanding of **string manipulation**, **character encoding**, and basic **cryptographic principles**.

---

#### 📝 Text Editor

Develop a basic text editor with fundamental features. You can start with simple file **I/O** (opening, saving), and then add features like creating new files and displaying file content. This project provides a solid foundation in **file system interactions** and **GUI development**.

---

#### 🛒 Inventory Management System

Create a system to manage the inventory of a store or warehouse. This application would involve defining **data structures** for items, quantities, and prices, and then implementing functions to add, remove, and update products. This project is excellent for practicing **data persistence** and **structuring a complex application**.

---

#### 📊 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Build an interactive tool that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort). This project requires a strong grasp of **algorithms**, and it is a great way to practice **graphics programming** or **GUI updates** to animate the sorting process.

---

#### 📑 Markdown Previewer

Design a lightweight application that renders Markdown text in real time. The user can type Markdown on one side of the screen, and the formatted output will be displayed on the other. This project is a great way to learn about **text parsing**, **string rendering**, and **dynamic user interface updates**.

---

#### ☁️ Weather Tracker

Build a desktop application that displays the current weather and a short-term forecast for a user-specified city. This project will challenge you to make and handle **API requests** to a weather service like OpenWeatherMap, parse the **JSON data** it returns, and update your UI dynamically.

---

#### 📂 File Organizer

Create a utility that automatically sorts files in a specified folder into subdirectories based on their file type (e.g., all `.jpg` files go into an "Images" folder, `.docx` files go into a "Documents" folder). This project is ideal for practicing **file system operations** and handling **file metadata**.

---

#### 📋 To-Do List Application

Develop a simple application for managing tasks. It should allow users to add new tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. This project is a great way to learn about **data persistence** by saving the list of tasks to a local file, such as a JSON or plain text file.

---

#### 📈 Stock Price Tracker

Build an application that fetches and displays real-time stock prices for a given company. This project is a great way to practice handling **APIs** that update frequently and managing **asynchronous data**. You can expand this by visualizing price changes with simple charts.

---

#### 🎶 Music Player

Develop a basic music player that can play local audio files. This project will teach you about **media playback libraries** and handling **file paths** and formats. A user interface would include play, pause, and skip buttons, as well as a list of available songs.

---

#### ⏱️ Pomodoro Timer

Develop a utility to help users manage their time using the Pomodoro Technique. The application will alternate between work and break intervals. This project is excellent for practicing **timers** and **GUI updates** to display the remaining time, as well as handling **user inputs** to start, pause, or reset the timer.
