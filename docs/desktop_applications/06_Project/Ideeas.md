### Project Ideas

Here are a few project ideas, ranging from desktop utilities to educational tools, that leverage various programming concepts. Each project is designed to help you build practical skills and create a portfolio-ready application.

#### 🌍 Country Guesser

Create a game that challenges users to identify a country based on data retrieved from an API, such as `REST Countries`. This project will focus on **HTTP requests**, **JSON parsing**, and handling **asynchronous data**. You can present information like the country's flag, capital city, or population, prompting the user to make a guess.

#### 🔐 Cryptography Application

Build a simple desktop application for encrypting and decrypting messages. Implement classic ciphers like the **Caesar Cipher** or the **XOR Cipher**. This project will strengthen your understanding of **string manipulation**, **character encoding**, and basic **cryptographic principles**.

---

#### 📝 Text Editor

Develop a basic text editor with fundamental features. You can start with simple file **I/O** (opening, saving), and then add features like creating new files and displaying file content. This project provides a solid foundation in **file system interactions** and **GUI development**.

#### 🛒 Inventory Management System

Create a system to manage the inventory of a store or warehouse. This application would involve defining **data structures** for items, quantities, and prices, and then implementing functions to add, remove, and update products. This project is excellent for practicing **data persistence** and **structuring a complex application**.

---

#### 📊 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Build an interactive tool that visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort). This project requires a strong grasp of **algorithms**, and it is a great way to practice **graphics programming** or **GUI updates** to animate the sorting process.

#### 📑 Markdown Previewer

Design a lightweight application that renders Markdown text in real time. The user can type Markdown on one side of the screen, and the formatted output will be displayed on the other. This project is a great way to learn about **text parsing**, **string rendering**, and **dynamic user interface updates**.
