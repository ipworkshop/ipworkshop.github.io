Welcome to **Desktop Applications with Rust & Slint**!  
This week, you will learn to create **desktop applications**, using **Rust** for the business logic and **Slint** for the graphical interface.

The course is structured to gradually take you from the fundamentals of Rust, to UI integration, and finally to completing a full project that you will present at the end of the camp.

## Course Structure 


### 1. Rust Essentials
Learn the core Rust concepts needed for building desktop applications:
- Installing and configuring Rust & Cargo
- Project structure
- Variables, mutability, and shadowing
- Data types
- Functions and basic control flow
- Ownership & Borrowing
- References and slices
- Error handling with `Result` and `Option`


### 2. Structs, Enums & Collections
Rust data structures and collections:
- Defining `struct` and `enum` types
- Pattern matching with `match`
- Common collections: `Vec`, `HashMap`, `String`
- Implementing methods with `impl` blocks
- Module organization in Rust projects


### 3. Building User Interfaces with Slint
Create UIs using Slint:
- Project setup and `.slint` files
- UI basics: Text, Image, Button, Input
- Layouts: `VerticalLayout`, `HorizontalLayout`, `GridLayout`
- Components and reusability
- Data binding between Rust and Slint
- Handling events: button clicks, input changes


### 4. Data Persistence & Local Storage
Learn to store and retrieve data:
- File I/O with `std::fs`
- JSON serialization and deserialization with `serde` and `serde_json`
- (Optional) SQLite introduction for local databases/Diesel ORM
- Binding persistent data to the UI


### 5. Networking & APIs
Learn to fetch and display remote data:
- Performing HTTP requests with `reqwest`
- Basics of `async` / `await` in Rust
- Fetching data from public APIs
- Updating the UI with remote data
- Error handling for network requests


### 6. Final Project
Apply everything you have learned to build a complete Rust + Slint application.

## What is this course about?

This course is about **building real desktop applications** from start to finish.  

You will take an idea, turn it into a working app with an interface, and by the end, youâ€™ll have a **complete desktop application** you can run and showcase.
